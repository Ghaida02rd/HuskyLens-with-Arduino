# HuskyLens-with-Arduino
Build a function in HuskyLens for face detection and LED control

## Description
This task demonstrates how to use the HuskyLens AI camera module to detect faces and control an LED based on the detection status. When a face is detected by the HuskyLens, the LED will turn on. If no face is detected, the LED will remain off.
